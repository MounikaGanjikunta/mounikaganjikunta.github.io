      I'm currently working as a Sr. Application Developer at Kentucky State govt in the Public Protection Cabinet. I have graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.uga.edu/graduate-students" target="_blank">The University of Georgia with a Masters in Computer Science in May 2023</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      As a computer science grad student, I enjoy bridging the gap between study and application combining my technical knowledge
      with keen eye for detail. I aspire and work towards building applications that are scalable
      and efficient.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably singing, playing table-tennis or cooking my favorite food.
